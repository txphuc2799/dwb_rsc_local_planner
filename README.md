# The integration of ROS2's Rotation Shim Controller with ROS's DWB Local Planner.

***Description:*** **I noticed that ROS2 has a Rotation Shim Controller written by Steve Macenski, and its integration with the ROS2 DWB Local Planner is highly effective. Therefore, I modified the ROS DWB Local Planner and added the Rotation Shim Controller. I successfully tested it in simulation.**

**Installation:** After downloading, first, you need to place the **dwb_rsc_msgs** package in your workspace, for example: catkin_ws. After that, build that workspace before adding the remaining 4 packages; otherwise, errors may occur.
