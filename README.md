# The integration of ROS2's Rotation Shim Controller with ROS1's DWB Local Planner.

## Description: I noticed that ROS2 has a Rotation Shim Controller written by Steve Macenski, and its integration with the ROS2 DWB Local Planner is highly effective. Therefore, I modified the ROS DWB Local Planner and added the Rotation Shim Controller. I successfully tested it in simulation.
